# Minecraft auto clicker [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/syncac)
Synchronizes clicks with Carpet Mod TPS logger in the player list footer. This mod is good if you're running a laggy farm on a not so fast server and it's not working due to attack cooldowns being slower. Works in GUIs too!

### How to use:
Go on a server with carpet, type 
```
/log tps
```
You should see the TPS and MSPT in the player list footer

The auto clicker should now sync with the server TPS
